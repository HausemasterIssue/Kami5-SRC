Decompiled source code of the Kami-5 client, publicly available. This client is mediocre, I haven't tested it but It does look OK. As usual, the SRC is not buildable, it's just the SRC from the prebuilt .jar. No hate to the developers, I think the developer is mmmax, so good job on that client.

P.S. Fuck Kami Blue, SALHACK ON TOP!
